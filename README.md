# The NHL Ice Scraper - a web scraping app for NHL News

This app uses Cheerio and Axios to scrape the NHL's website for headlines, summaries, and links to articles. The user can then comment on the article. All of this is stored on MongoDB.

## Challenges

Using a web scraper for the first time was very difficult. It took a while to figure out the right way to get the information I needed, and it took a lot of different tries on different sites to do so. I went for a simple approach with my routes just to get the app working, but the comments and saved articles need some work.

## Technologies Used

HTML/CSS, Handlebars, Express, Node, Cheerio, Morgan (for logging tests)
